# TestPlan-and-TestCase-on-TAKA-
The Test Plan was created by me and my team mate Rushmia Ahmed Hrida. The Test Case was prepared by me. Both are prepared based on the learning of manual qa training and made on a MFS app named TAKA. The main modules on which the testing was fosued are Registration, Cash In, Cash Out, PayBill, Mobile Recharge and Send Money.
